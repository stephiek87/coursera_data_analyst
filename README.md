Working through the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera

Current module:
Module 4: Python for Data Science, AI & Development

This is the python practice lab assignments throughout this module. Having completed the python certificate on Codecademy really helped me get through this module on the Coursera website.

I'll be using this repository to add the lessons as I go and work on utilizing Github as well.
